This is an example in order to showcase the auto suggest parser feature.
The idea is that an incomplete grammar can be parsed and the parser will
suggest the next set of tokens. This feature can help end users consume/use
a defined syntax without having to know all the productions/lexical units.

The example is based around query strings with regards to a book database.
In this example you have the following options:

find ( author | title ) with time-range and "criteria"
or
textsearch "book" with "criteria" [ and time-range ]
